<b>Actually, I have no intention on finishing this because HTML/CSS/JS/React/Angluar (not as a profession) is easy and can be quickly grasped if needed. A website/portfolio does very little to define a person.</b>

<p>Summary of me: 
Canadian born Chinese Christian studying CS at UWaterloo '24. 
Before grade 6, I moved schools every year => resilience and very flexible to change and stress.

Does problem solving: top 100 of 10000 for 2018 CSMC
Does swimming: top 10 in Ontario for some OFSAA 2017 swimming thing
Trained in CPR stuff.
I enjoy the above, art, cooking, photography, and movies.

Worked at Teranet CMS to make ETL and QA. (coop)
Does tutoring for STEM highschool/first-year courses for high achievers. (6 years+)
Helps run a local highschool annual hacakthon (cost-free, 100+ ppl, amazing 'swag', food, and prizes).
